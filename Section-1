Types of AI 
o Generative AI 
o Machine learning 
o Statistical learning 
o Transformers 
o Deep learning 
o Natural language processing (NLP) 
===========================
 Large language models (LLMs) 
 Small language models (SLMs) 
 Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
==========================

LLM
Are trained on vast data sets
GPT4, gemini 
Deep contextual o/p
 SLM tiny get - Exceeding in lightweight tasks

Model Size — LLM Billions o parameter
Hight Computational resources
High quality and context rich 
Creative writing and deep analysis  sophisticated responses
Higher latency 
Higher GPUs
Extensive Cloud resources 
Customer service chatbot    SLM 
Virtual Assistance  Quick Turnaround etc.

GANs — Generative Adversarial Networks  What are GANs How does it work 
Examples of usage.

Generative models 
That use unsupervised learning model
It lacks output variable, has only input variable 
The output is based on I/p variable.
 Images , text, Audio, Video 
If you want to generate new data then use GAN
**Conditional GANs? From younger to older image
You gave the older image and tell it to generate younger self 
**Pix2Pix GAN 
Gan  converts pencil drawn network into realistic picture
**STACK GAN 
Create image based on given description
**SRGAN
Super Resolution GAN  
Low resolution image into better analysis


How does the model look like.

Two neural networks are used 
1. Generator
2. Discriminator In case of data for training : Random noise becomes input to generator Random Noise is sequence of Random Numbers 
3. Z~N(0,1) — Normal distribution/Gaussian Distribution Z here is Random Noise  0 = Mean  1 = Standard deviation

How we can do it with python code

Import numpy as np 
Z = np.random.normal(0,1,size(1,5))
print(“Gaussian Noise Vector”)

Generators task is to create fake image  Generator now has multiple steps  [Refer image]
Every image will have height and width and then the RVG for colours
Now the random numbers should create the image
 We are using Dense layer and Reshare layer

Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning 
supervised learning - 
>> Data is labeled, you know the i/p and the o/p 
>> We know from data what is the input and what is the output 
>> Ex Housing price

Unsupervised learning 
>> We do noy know what the o/p would be.
>> It finds patterns in data 
>> Are computationally complex
>> Less Accurate.

A hyperparameter in Artificial Intelligence (AI) — especially in Machine Learning (ML) — is a parameter whose value is set before the training process begins, and it controls how the model learns.

What is HYPER-parameter tuning?
Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to improve its performance
