Types of AI 
o Generative AI 
o Machine learning 
o Statistical learning 
o Transformers 
o Deep learning 
o Natural language processing (NLP) 
 Large language models (LLMs) 
 Small language models (SLMs) 
 Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
==========================

LLM
Are trained on vast data sets
GPT4, gemini 
Deep contextual o/p
 SLM tiny get - Exceeding in lightweight tasks

Model Size — LLM Billions o parameter
Hight Computational resources
High quality and context rich 
Creative writing and deep analysis  sophisticated responses
Higher latency 
Higher GPUs
Extensive Cloud resources 
Customer service chatbot    SLM 
Virtual Assistance  Quick Turnaround etc.

GANs — Generative Adversarial Networks  What are GANs How does it work 
Examples of usage.

Generative models 
That use unsupervised learning model
It lacks output variable, has only input variable 
The output is based on I/p variable.
 Images , text, Audio, Video 
If you want to generate new data then use GAN
**Conditional GANs? From younger to older image
You gave the older image and tell it to generate younger self 
**Pix2Pix GAN 
Gan  converts pencil drawn network into realistic picture
**STACK GAN 
Create image based on given description
**SRGAN
Super Resolution GAN  
Low resolution image into better analysis


How does the model look like.
